Anomaly Detection

The purpose of this project was to explore the use of clustering models in data science. The data for this project was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab or https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data . This data was used to create models to determine the anomalies in the data, using the other columns as features.
