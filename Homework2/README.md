The data used for this project was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays .  The data contains information regarding the speaking lines of characters in Shakespeare's various plays, including the character in the play, the section of the play, and the speaking part of the character. The purpose of this project was to explore this data and determine if any models could be constructed to analyze the data and to help predict which character stated a given line.  The experimental analysis will be similar to the approaches taken to analyze the titanic survival data set, in which the goal was to predict which group of people (men, women, or children) and which social class (upper, middle, or lower) were the most likely to survive the famous catastrophe.  The models being constructed in this experiment will be implementing pair plots and support vector machines.
